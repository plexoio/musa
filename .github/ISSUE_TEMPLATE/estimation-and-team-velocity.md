| Epic                        | User Story                   | Priority | Story Point Estimation | Assumptions/rationale |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Epic Description]           | #1 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #2 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #3 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #4 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |

## Prediction
- Team Velocity: [Number of User Stories per iteration]
- Number of iterations required: [Number of iterations]
- Duration per iteration: [Duration per iteration]
- Estimated release: [Estimated release]
- Assumption: [Assumption]

## Note

- Calculate the number of story points (S)
- Get average team velocity (T)
- S/T = Iterations (I) to do
- Get average time per iteration (A)
- I * A = Get Estimated Time (W)
- W = Days, Weeks, Months, Years...
