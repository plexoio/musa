## Agile Table

| Epic                        | User Story                   | Priority | Story Point Estimation | Assumptions/rationale |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Epic Description]           | #1 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #2 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #3 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |
| [Epic Description]           | #4 [User Story Description]  | [Priority] | [Story Point Estimation] | [Assumptions/rationale] |

## Prediction
- Team Velocity: [Number of Stories Points per iteration]
- Iterations required: [Number of iterations]
- Duration per iteration: [Duration per iteration]
- Estimated release: [Estimated release]
- Assumption: [Assumption]

## Note

- Calculate the number of story points (S) per iteration
- Get average team velocity (T)
- S/T = Iterations (I) to do
- Get average time per iteration (A)
- I * A = Get Estimated Time (W)
- W = Days, Weeks, Months, Years...

## Reminder

The traditional Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is obtained by adding the two preceding terms:

- 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

In the Modified Fibonacci sequence, we start with three initial terms instead of two, and each subsequent term is calculated by summing up the three preceding terms:

- 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, ...
