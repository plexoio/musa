# Actual Features Explained

We are quite pleased with our achievements, despite initial concerns about time constraints. Reflecting on the project, it's evident that all features can be enhanced and further developed in the future. This iteration has simplified design elements and provides all CRUD functionalities such as create event, read event, update event, delete accounts, performing vote & time calculations as well as proper feedback at all times.

The following main features proved essential for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP):

## Homepage

### Header & CTA Section
The header introduces users to the platform with a clear call-to-action (CTA) that encourages them to participate or learn more about the voting events available.
