## 7. Conclusion
The development team has finalized the must-have features for both the front-end and back-end of the voting system. These include:

**Front-End:**
- Verification badge
- Comprehensive User Profile
- System Status Page
- Materialize
- JQuery
- Continuous user feedback
- Vote counting and progress bar (no persuasive data) on homepage
- FAQs
- Video tutorials
- Contact form
- Accessibility
- User dashboard (Event creation, CRUD where needed)
- Sign up/in

**Back-End:**
- Image compression
- Lazy loading
- Caching
- DNS management
- Cloudflare integration
- KYC
- Anonymity option
- Clean code practices and tests
- Admin dashboard (CRUD)

The team will also design a database model for user and admin roles and highlights the importance of culture, engagement, and visual elements in shaping the user experience. This includes keywords, colors, progress bars, shapes, interactivity, Lottie files, and illustrations.

PWA features, two-factor authentication, email verification, and internet and transportation map integrations will be considered. The next steps involve a proof-of-concept and designing a database model, with

By using Darek Cabrera's measure of difficulty, the product can be considered to evolve from being Complicated to Complex due to its multiple functionalities. Important factors to consider are making the platform global or local based on user preferences, providing users with filtering options for content customization, and making the product more user-friendly and less bureaucratic. All of these considerations aim to provide a more inclusive and user-friendly experience. 
Next Steps:
-	Start with proof-of-concept and database model
-	Consider using template examples and video learning resources for RDBMS
-	Progress with the proof-of-concept and database model for future development
Session Reminder:
-	The session name "Musa Attack" serves as a reminder for future reference.
-	Return to the relevant documents for more details and explanations.
-	Due to a two-week timeframe for the MVP creation, some features will be deferred to future iterations. 
-	A guerrilla test is not possible for this iteration.
