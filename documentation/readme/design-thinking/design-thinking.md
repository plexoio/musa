# Design Thinking
We wanted to give it a try this time by implementing design thinking before even attempting to work on the user-centric design.

We tested a total of **4 real people**, which is not ideal, but the results were just as surprising as if we had tested more individuals.

After conducting deductive reasoning, we found that the tested users agreed on the following problems and needs: transparency, better layout and presentation, motivation, reduction of external influences, KYC (Know Your Customer), security, anonymity, assistance, legality, traditional & modern technologies, inclusivity, and performance.

The detailed problems and desired solutions can be found in the design thinking paper for the Musa voting system.

Finally, we have identified our problems and solutions for this first iteration, although there is still much to be included. We will definitely clarify things further when conducting the user-centric design.

To assist us in the next step, we have developed a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) mind map to illustrate what is expected for this iteration. Adhering to this will guarantee that we are meeting the expectations of real users and solving a real-life problem rather than relying on speculation or imagination.
