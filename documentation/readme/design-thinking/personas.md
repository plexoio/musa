# Persona

## Persona 1: Anna
- **Age:** 24 
- **Location:** Ukraine
- **Profession:** Philologist

**What do you expect from a voting system?**
- *Answer:* To be transparent and fair, no mistakes. I value both civilian participation and computerized calculations in the scrutiny process.

**What would you like to see improved and why?**
- *Answer:* I would like an electronic voting system that would eliminate the need to physically move from one place to another. A system with proper identification for trust and confidence and better campaign promotions would be beneficial.

**We live in a society where democracy is always at stake. What if we already have a technology to solve this issue using both traditional and modern technologies?**

- *Answer:* Concerns include hackers, system failure, double voting, updating a database at the government side when voting, but also maintaining anonymity in the process.

- *Answer:* Yes, but assistance with technology would be necessary. We would need to design proper organizations or groups for this assistance.

**In overall, after discovering yourself throughout this questionary, how can you explain your problem related to a voting system?**
- *Answer:* I would like to implement an electronic voting system because it would help people vote at home. I think this will encourage more people to vote as well, as it reduces intervention from others. Although security is still a concern, legality and rules cannot be compromised. I look forward to a better display of the voting list, more metadata, purpose, background, and more; a more descriptive sheet I expect. I'd also like access to extra resources on the same electoral station before making a final decision and without people trying to convince me.
