# Proof of Concept: The Prototype 

In line with Musa's project, we have ventured to develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) that finds its roots in the principles of design thinking research. This prototype will serve as the cornerstone in establishing our user-centric design. It will also function as a primary source of innovative ideas for implementation and provide comprehensive documentation for problem-solving.
