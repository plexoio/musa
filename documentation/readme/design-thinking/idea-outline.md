## Idea Outline
### Hypothesis
1. **Empathy: Your Opinion Matters**
    - **Trust's Significance:** A voting system denotes reliance on sophisticated and abstract mechanisms that are orchestrated to instill trust, foster economy, and enhance efficiency.
    - **Promoting Participation:** A properly designed system empowers individuals to vote confidently and actively engage in their social group's decision-making processes, irrespective of their geographic location. Additionally, the system should facilitate easy creation of voting sessions by anyone, thereby reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
    - **Technology Augmenting Human Capabilities:** In essence, voting signifies democracyâ€” the civilized and proper execution of one's will, facilitated by both traditional and modern technologies such as Blockchain.

2. **Definition: A Secure and Reliable Voting System**
    - **The Importance of Simplicity:** We aim to design our system for everyone above the age of 18, ensuring it is accessible and easy to use for individuals across all age groups. The goal is to render the underlying technology invisible to both creators and voters, thereby letting them focus on their campaign's scope: awareness.
    - **Aligning with the Real World:** After defining the system's potential, we prioritize community engagement. A transparent and proper representation of the voting process will motivate more people to participate.
    - **The Role of Decentralized Technologies:** In future versions, the system will connect to a Blockchain that autonomously and decentralizedly manages the voting process. This connection will be safeguarded by an ultra-secure consensus mechanism to guarantee data immutability and integrity.

3. **Ideation: An Agnostic Approach to KYC**
    - **Identity First:** We firmly believe in differentiating genuine people from bots. Our present strategy involves using a centralized KYC system to store and process data, while also leveraging a mix of centralized and decentralized technologies. Blockchain users will also need to verify their identities to vote.
    - **Behind-the-scenes Magic:** We intend to use various technologies, including frameworks, packages, libraries, and modules, to quickly achieve the first iteration. User-centric design, accessibility, and security will be prioritized at every development stage, encompassing both front-end and back-end aspects.
    - **Recognition:** Future iterations will strive to gain national and international recognition. Ideally, the system would collaborate with government entities to establish KYC procedures and obtain security certificates. The involvement of esteemed entities with significant authority, be they companies, public institutions, or private organizations, is crucial.

## Maslow's Hierarchy
### Basic Needs:
1. **Physiological Needs:**
    - User Experience and Device Accessibility: Ensuring a user-friendly and accessible interface for a seamless voting experience.
2. **Safety Needs:**
    - Authority, Recognition, and Transparency: Building trust by establishing authority, seeking recognition from reputable entities, and maintaining transparency throughout the voting process.

### Psychological Needs:
3. **Belongingness and Love Needs:**
    - Voting Block with Descriptive Information, Images, and Progress Bar: Presenting a visually engaging voting platform that includes descriptive information, images, and a progress bar. Highlighting the campaign's mission and its potential impact on various communities, such as Venezuelans, worldwide, Spain, and China.
4. **Esteem Needs:**
    - Social Media Sharing: Allowing users to easily share their voting process participation on social media. Providing follow-up links to the cause and updates to foster a sense of achievement and engagement.

### Self-fulfillment Needs:
5. **Self-Actualization:**
    - Adding Participation to CV: Offering users the ability to add their participation in crucial decision-making processes at national and international levels to their CV and LinkedIn, etc. Providing a status of achievement and linking to a detailed article that showcases the results contributes to self-actualization.
6. **Contribution to Good Deeds Locally and Globally:** Inspiring a sense of making positive contributions both locally and globally through the act of voting, thus fostering a sense of fulfillment and impact.
