## Idea Outline
### Hypothesis
1. **Empathy: Your Opinion Matters**
    - **Trust's Significance:** A voting system denotes reliance on sophisticated and abstract mechanisms that are orchestrated to instill trust, foster economy, and enhance efficiency.
    - **Promoting Participation:** A properly designed system empowers individuals to vote confidently and actively engage in their social group's decision-making processes, irrespective of their geographic location. Additionally, the system should facilitate easy creation of voting sessions by anyone, thereby reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
    - **Technology Augmenting Human Capabilities:** In essence, voting signifies democracy— the civilized and proper execution of one's will, facilitated by both traditional and modern technologies such as Blockchain.

2. **Definition: A Secure and Reliable Voting System**
    - **The Importance of Simplicity:** We aim to design our system for everyone above the age of 18, ensuring it is accessible and easy to use for individuals across all age groups. The goal is to render the underlying technology invisible to both creators and voters, thereby letting them focus on their campaign's scope: awareness.
    - **Aligning with the Real World:** After defining the system's potential, we prioritize community engagement. A transparent and proper representation of the voting process will motivate more people to participate.
    - **The Role of Decentralized Technologies:** In future versions, the system will connect to a Blockchain that autonomously and decentralizedly manages the voting process. This connection will be safeguarded by an ultra-secure consensus mechanism to guarantee data immutability and integrity.

3. **Ideation: An Agnostic Approach to KYC**
    - **Identity First:** We firmly believe in differentiating genuine people from bots. Our present strategy involves using a centralized KYC system to store and process data, while also leveraging a mix of centralized and decentralized technologies. Blockchain users will also need to verify their identities to vote.
    - **Behind-the-scenes Magic:** We intend to use various technologies, including frameworks, packages, libraries, and modules, to quickly achieve the first iteration. User-centric design, accessibility, and security will be prioritized at every development stage, encompassing both front-end and back-end aspects.
    - **Recognition:** Future iterations will strive to gain national and international recognition. Ideally, the system would collaborate with government entities to establish KYC procedures and obtain security certificates. The involvement of esteemed entities with significant authority, be they companies, public institutions, or private organizations, is crucial.

## Maslow's Hierarchy
### Basic Needs:
1. **Physiological Needs:**
    - User Experience and Device Accessibility: Ensuring a user-friendly and accessible interface for a seamless voting experience.
2. **Safety Needs:**
    - Authority, Recognition, and Transparency: Building trust by establishing authority, seeking recognition from reputable entities, and maintaining transparency throughout the voting process.

### Psychological Needs:
3. **Belongingness and Love Needs:**
    - Voting Block with Descriptive Information, Images, and Progress Bar: Presenting a visually engaging voting platform that includes descriptive information, images, and a progress bar. Highlighting the campaign's mission and its potential impact on various communities, such as Venezuelans, worldwide, Spain, and China.
4. **Esteem Needs:**
    - Social Media Sharing: Allowing users to easily share their voting process participation on social media. Providing follow-up links to the cause and updates to foster a sense of achievement and engagement.

### Self-fulfillment Needs:
5. **Self-Actualization:**
    - Adding Participation to CV: Offering users the ability to add their participation in crucial decision-making processes at national and international levels to their CV and LinkedIn, etc. Providing a status of achievement and linking to a detailed article that showcases the results contributes to self-actualization.
6. **Contribution to Good Deeds Locally and Globally:** Inspiring a sense of making positive contributions both locally and globally through the act of voting, thus fostering a sense of fulfillment and impact.

# Ideate

## Let’s go green

1. **Transparency:** Event creators must be verified - a badge of verification is essential. In addition, they need to offer an open and transparent profile on the app. Official support could play a role in ensuring this. We should also provide a specific page for system status updates.
2. **Presentation:** The use of Materialize can enhance the display, layout, description, and metadata of candidates, thereby providing comprehensive information to voters. Considerations for color contrast, auditory feedback, and appropriate user response should also be made.
3. **Device Compatibility:** The advantage of using a website is that it is accessible by default on various devices. Implementing PWA functionality could further enhance this.
4. **Low Data Consumption:** Image compression when uploading from the user’s side is crucial to reduce data usage. As administrators, we should also implement this. We should aim to reduce the amount of data loaded by utilizing proper caching and DNS infrastructure, like Cloudflare.
5. **Motivation for Participation:** The faster users can access important data, the less likely they are to give up midway. Progress bars, colors, shapes, interactivity, news, and key information are critical. Show users through keywords and phrases that they are about to change the world. Consider accumulating exchangeable points for participating (optional).
6. **Reduce External Influences:** The presented information should not be persuasive; it cannot unintentionally favor a particular candidate or decision. Displaying how many people have voted compared to the expected turnout, and presenting this as a progress bar, might be effective. Comments and reactions should not compromise the event.
7. **KYC (Know Your Customer):** Both voters and creators should verify their accounts. The backend system should be robust enough to prevent duplicates or deceased individuals from voting. We could also rely on a third-party system for this.
8. **Security:** Prioritize user security with measures such as two-factor authentication, Google verification, SMS, email verification, security questions, and extra codes for actions. The backend should incorporate security measures like SiteLock. Connect the database to the blockchain, submitting only relevant data, to protect user privacy. Ensure both databases always match.
9. **Anonymity:** Users should have the option to display only one name or remain completely anonymous.
10. **Assistance System:** Incorporate FAQs and videos. Company staff or a third-party organization could provide online assistance.
11. **Legality:** Obtain necessary authorization before running legal events. Special verification for the user and the event should be in place. Follow imposed regulations.
12. **Paper-based and Electronic Options:** We might need to expand as a company to handle this ourselves. Initially, we could rely on a third-party, while also improving our systems.
13. **Blockchain:** Blockchain could utilize an oracle blockchain (Chainlink), its own smart contract for automation, and centralized systems combined. Consider including MetaMask real login method for the next iteration.
14. **Inclusivity:** Pay attention to accessibility. Include a library for reading aloud the event or recommend apps, choose the right font size and style. Always display an assistance button. An AI chatbot could help resolve questions.
15. **Internet Connection:** Use our own or a third-party service to display nearby Internet Connectivity, or if the event offers internet connection using Starlink to provide the data. Offer different working methods of our own or others.
16. **Transportation System:** Same as the last one. Include it in the voting card.
17. **Fast System:** Use the best technology, servers, and clean code that runs the system. Pass all different performance tests.

**Final word on this session:**
We believe, using Darek Cabrera's measure of difficulty, that the product complexity can range from Complicated to Complex. As we can't control how users handle their variables, we need to consider:

1. **Option to make it worldwide or local:** The product should offer flexibility to cater both global and local needs, providing features that can be customized or adapted based on specific cultural contexts.
2. **Filtering options:** Implementing filtering options can allow users to tailor their experience according to their preferences and cultural sensitivities. This empowers users to control the content they engage with, ensuring a more personalized and relevant experience.
3. **Making things look more familiar, approachable, and less bureaucratic:** To instill a sense of purpose and pride among users, it is vital to design the product in a way that resonates with their cultural values and aesthetics. This can be achieved by using familiar concepts, language, and design elements.

Finding solutions goes beyond coding and technical aspects. It requires understanding the underlying concepts, applying logical thinking, making good design decisions, and considering the cultural implications of those choices. By incorporating these elements, the product can better address the needs and preferences of its users, promoting a more inclusive and user-friendly experience.
