# Strategy Plane - Reason, Solution, and Value

In this phase, we analyze the data obtained from conducting 4 different interviews with individuals from diverse backgrounds. These interviews have provided valuable insights into the general and specific aspects of a `voting system`.

Based on our findings from the `design thinking` process, we have reached the following conclusions, which will serve as our `official source of information` for Musa's MVP:

Although our users may not have had a complete understanding of their needs, we made every effort to comprehend their requirements and propose the best possible solutions.

Recognizing that users are the key stakeholders, our primary focus is to create a platform that benefits both business professionals and future users.

Transparency, security, presentation, accessibility, and performance are critical concerns for our users. To address these issues, we will tackle specific problems and fulfill their desires, enabling them to thrive within the ecosystem.

For this iteration, we have identified the following core technologies to utilize:

- Django (MVC/MVT)
- JQuery
- Materialize
- PostgreSQL
- psycopg2
- SQLAlchemy
- Font Awesome
- Lottie Files

To address individual issues, tasks, or desires, please refer to the following resources:

- [Design-Thinking Prototype](https://github.com/plexoio/musa/blob/main/documentation/readme/design-thinking/prototype.md)

Our insights are grounded in sufficient research, supported by the accompanying table and graphic:

- From this table, we can extract the themes, epics, and potential ideas for user stories.

### Research

Sure, based on the combined score (Relevancy + Viability) of each item, the table would be arranged in descending order as follows:
