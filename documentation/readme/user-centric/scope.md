# Scope Plane - Features and Capabilities

On this plane, we must be realistic and carefully consider the features that will be implemented. We need to brainstorm and keep in mind that we have less than two weeks for the first iteration of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Time, technologies, and knowledge all play a crucial role in making the final decision.

    It is important to clarify that in Agile Development, nothing is set in stone. We make flexible estimations that may change over time, either positively or negatively. We allow for changes at any stage of the development process.

Fortunately, we are utilizing the `Django framework`, which aligns with the philosophy of "for perfectionists with deadlines." This framework empowers us to build a functional application within a remarkably short timeframe.

For this iteration, we have made the decision to incorporate features and functionalities based on the following conditions and goals:

| Condition                     | Iteration                                                          | Goals                         |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| MVP Version                  | Display voting cards on homepage<br>Sign in/up option<br>Event Voting page<br>User Profile (roles)<br>Vote count and progress bar<br>Anonymity option | Culture acquisition            |
| Simple design                | Contact Form<br>User/Admin Dashboard<br>System Status Page<br>FAQ<br>Feedback after voting<br>Previous features* | Tech Showcase                 |
| Low leading rates<br>& Non-functional | KYC, Search Engine & Filters<br>Verification Badge                              | Long-term Investment<br>& Future Implementation |

- As evident from the table, the items listed under the `MVP Version` row will be included in the development process. However, it is important to note that the level of sophistication may not be the highest objectively speaking. Nonetheless, these features will be functional and meet the necessary requirements.

- In the subsequent `Simple Design` row, these items are also crucial for the project, although some may not receive the same level of attention as the key functional features. This approach applies to all features in general, as the primary purpose is to showcase our powerful technology.

- Regarding the last row, `Low leading rates & Non-functional`, incorporating the listed items will pose a challenge, and we will make an attempt to include them. However, due to the limited timeframe, we cannot make any promises about including all of them. These items will definitely be prioritized for the next iteration.
