# Skeleton Plane - Layout, Interaction and Relationship

Our `meticulous` approach to this project has helped us `tremendously` in building a stunning and revealing prototype. All ideas for this iteration and requirements were meticulously brought together.

At this point, we acknowledge that the final product may look a bit different. However, a prototype is always a good starting point and serves as our new official base to consult while developing for `more immediate visual and rapid feedback`.

Our progression has followed a logical sequence: `Strategy, Scope, Structure`, and now we find ourselves at the `Skeleton` stage.

Until now, our ideas may have existed in abstract forms, perhaps as scattered drawings on paper without clear cohesion. However, in the `Skeleton` phase, we can finally grasp the essence of our projects. We can visualize the instances and achieve a higher level of abstraction that allows us to perceive the project as a cohesive whole, which is `incredibly useful` for the programming part as well.

At this stage, all the `features, functionalities, elements' interactions, and content layouts` are visible and comprehensible. We can understand the interconnectedness of each component we have been diligently working on.

For this phase, we have opted to utilize `Adobe XD`, a software the author is experienced with. This tool provides a comprehensive wireframe that enhances our workflow and enables us to collaborate effectively.

The `user-friendly` and `straightforward navigation` is prominently visible, making everything just a few clicks away from the user's goal. The priorities are also crystal clear: first, the `Homepage` with the voting cards and extra info; second, the dedicated `Voting page` as expected; and after that, users can either `Login or register` immediately or explore the `Support` dropdown section.

Notice the progression from simple to more complex functionalities and layouts. Users can seamlessly `learn as they navigate through the website`, and we are committed to avoiding overwhelming them. We take the concept of `progressive disclosure` seriously, ensuring that important data is presented without conveying any subliminal messages or attempting to persuade them to vote for a specific cause.

We invested considerable time and resources into this process `prior to coding the actual product`, bringing it to life with careful planning.

Nothing is entirely new or surprising; `everything is designed intuitively`, considering users' habits, standards, and conventions.

We paid meticulous attention to `keywords, invisible information, hierarchies, and content in lists and forms`. These elements are all visible in our desktop-based `prototype/demo`.

Our primary focus was on keeping everything `simple, intuitive, and consistent`. At the same time, we laid the foundation for our final phase by defining `colors, shapes, and other essential design elements`.

Our next destination is the `Surface plane`.
