## Test

We have discovered that using the `user story` as the `expected result` in manual testing is a valid approach. It ensures that the functionalities implemented align with the user's requirements or expectations as defined in the user story. By doing so, we're essentially validating that the developed feature or functionality meets the criteria described previously.
